Lab1CV: This Octave file provides functions for common mathematical and computational tasks, including matrix multiplication (custom implementation!), numerical root approximation (bisection method), 
sorting algorithms (bubble, merge, quicksort), efficient search (binary search), recursive factorial calculation, palindrome string checking, and basic statistics (mean, median, mode). 
Experiment with the examples provided to explore each function's capabilities!

Lab2CV: This Octave repository provides functions for various image processing tasks you can experiment with and submit. Replace the placeholder image paths with your own data! 
It covers: importing images with colormap exploration, resizing images, grayscale conversion methods, image cropping, interpolation techniques for resizing , image rotation,
image downloading from URLs, camera image capture (replace with your device ID and functionality might vary), loading images in different color spaces, extracting image metadata, 
adjusting pixel values, comparing image resolutions, converting images to different color spaces, and image enhancement techniques. 


Enjoy exploring the world of image processing in Octave!
